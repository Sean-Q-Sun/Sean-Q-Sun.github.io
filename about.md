## Does this count as doxxing myself?

Currently, I am a junior at the Rochester Institute of Techonlogy studying **Computing Security**. At school, I am the **Preisdent** for <a class="link1" href="https://rc3.club">**RIT's Competitive Cybersecurity Club**</a>. At heart, I enjoy building and scaling organizations.

I like cybersecurity in itself, but I love the concept of fusing it with another aspect of our lives. Like with finance. *Gently whispers: blockchain*
