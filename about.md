## Does this count as doxxing myself?

Currently, I am a sophmore at the Rochester Institute of Technology with a major in **Computing Security**. At school, I work as the **Assistant System Administrator** for the Software Engineering Department, and I've also taken on the role **Competition Architect** for <a class="link1" href="https://rc3.club">**RIT's Competitive Cybersecurity Club**</a>. 

Back home, in New York City, I've worked on Wall Street for two summers working in **investment banking** which has guided my
interests towards the integration of secure technologies with economics.
