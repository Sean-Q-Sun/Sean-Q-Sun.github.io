## Does this count as doxxing myself?

Currently, I am a junior at the Rochester Institute of Techonlogy studying **Computing Security**. At school, I am the **Preisdent** for <a class="link1" href="https://rc3.club">**RIT's Competitive Cybersecurity Club**</a>. At heart, I am a **growth hacker**.

Back home, in New York City, I've worked on Wall Street for two summers working in **investment banking** which has guided my
interests towards the integration of secure technologies with economics.
